<p class="shout">Books for Mandela Day Sponsorship Opportunity</p>


<p class="quote">&lsquo;There can be no keener revelation of a society&rsquo;s soul than the way in which it treats its children.&rsquo;—Nelson Mandela</p>


<p>Book Dash, a voluntary organisation that creates beautiful children’s books, invites your organisation to sponsor a set of three storybooks for each of 250 pre-primary children on <a href="http://www.mandeladay.com/">Mandela Day</a>, 18 July 2014. By sponsoring R30&nbsp;000 for book printing:</p>


<ul>
<li>
You provide up to 250 children with three beautiful books each.
</li>
<li>
Your staff can join in, handing out books for their 67 minutes of service on Mandela Day.
</li>
<li>
Your branding goes on a bookmark included with each book. (This is intended for the parents to see.)
</li>
<li>
You share the lead in the PR story, alongside the children and Book Dash. This includes a press release and social media coverage.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>What is Book Dash?</h2>


<p>Book Dash is a voluntary association that gathers top creatives to make beautiful children’s books that anyone can translate, print and distribute.</p>


<p>Children in South Africa need more books, but they cost too much when purchased from publishers. The cheapest books have no publisher; then the only cost is printing. So our volunteers – all experienced creative professionals – donate their time to do the work of publishers. After that, anyone can get print runs sponsored and put finished books into the hands of children.</p>


<p>We believe every child should own a hundred books by the age of five. In South Africa, that means giving 600 million free books to children who could never afford to buy them. And this is an urgent need: on every day that we lose, more children grow up unable to read and write well, and to explore the worlds that books open up.</p>

</p>


<h2 id="">How are the books distributed?</h2>


<p>We work with great children's organisations, who will put the books directly into the hands of children. We believe that children must own their own books, and they must be able to collect many books throughout their childhood. We ask these organisations to make sure:</p>


<ul>
<li>Each child’s name is written on the book-plate page (‘This book belongs to’).</li>
<li>The giver must take a photograph of the book-plate page showing the name and the child holding the book (not including the child’s face for ethical reasons).</li>
<li>The photograph must be shared with us (e.g. on email, Facebook or Twitter) so that we can keep a record of books distributed.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="">Who gets the books on Mandela Day?</h2>


<p>We will be handing out books at Jireh Community Centre, who provide family-centred programmes and services to uplift their Mitchells Plain community. This includes a pre-primary childcare facility with 250 children, who’ll receive our books. You can read more about Jireh at <a href="http://www.jirehsa.org.za">www.jirehsa.org.za</a>.</p>


<h2 id="">Which books will we print?</h2>


<p>We’ve selected three books from our recent Book Dash events for printing:</p>


<ul>
<li><em>Kom terug, Kat!</em> about a cat who insists on doing its own thing. (Ages 1 to 3. Afrikaans.)</li>
<li><em>Sleepy Mr Sloth</em> about a sloth looking for a place to lay his head. (Ages 2 to 4. English.)</li>
<li><em>A Fish and a Gift</em> about a fisherman father looking for a gift for his son. (Ages 4 and up. English.)</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="images/kom-terug-kat.jpg" alt="Kom terug, Kat!" class="cover-thumb">
<img src="images/sleepy-mr-sloth.jpg" alt="Sleepy Mr Sloth" class="cover-thumb"></p>

<!--                <img src="images/a-fish-and-a-gift.jpg" alt="A Fish and a Gift" class="cover-thumb">-->




<p>The themes and stories in these books are perfect for the little children at Jireh Community Centre. The children are multilingual, so we're including English and an Afrikaans book. (Book Dash is working on more translations for future editions.)</p>
